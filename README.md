### Hi there, I'm Darts ðŸ˜Š

I'm a maxed 50 Attack/1 Defence/1 Prayer pure. I'm mainly an Old School Runescape player, but I also enjoy Runescape 3. I've been playing Runescape for nearly 20 years now.

I enjoy almost all aspects of the game, although most of my experience so far is with skilling. My current goal is 200m experience in all skills, except Attack, Defence, and Prayer. 

I'm a [Solace](https://templeosrs.com/groups/overview.php?id=56) clan friend, and the founder of [Limited Account Builds](https://discord.com/invite/gsAQKCM) (also known as Lab), an OSRS pure clan.
